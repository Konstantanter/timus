/* 2060. Subpalindrome pairs - http://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?num=2060
 *
 * Strategy:
 * First, record the size of the largest palindrome with center at every point inside the string
 * using Manacher's algorithm. Then use this information to calculate how many palindromes start
 * and end at any given position between the characters, as follows: 
 *   Given, say, the string "abcdcba", at every point between the first 'a' and the 'd', two new
 * palindromes will start - the single-letter palindrome ('a' to 'd'), as well as the subpalindrome
 * of the entire string that begins at that point ("abcdcba", "bcdcb", etc). From the 'd' to the
 * the second 'a', one palindrome will start at each character, which is the single-character
 * palindrome consisting of that character. Similarly, at every point just after the first 'a', and
 * just after the 'd', one single-letter palindrome will end, and at every point between the 'd'
 * and the second 'a', two palindromes will end. 
 *   To calculate this quickly for the starting positions (the ending positions are done similarly),
 * for each longest palindrome P at position i in the input string, we mark where P begins such a
 * sequence of characters where at each point a new subpalindrome starts (this is at position i-L 
 * where L is the length of P), and where such a sequence ends. After we've done so for every
 * palindrome, we can then "integrate" this to get the total number of palindromes that start at any
 * given point.
 *   After this we go through each point between the characters in the string and multiply together 
 * the number of palindromes that start and begin at such a point, and sum all those products
 * together to get the final result.
 *
 * Performance:
 * Linear in the size of the input, runs the tests in 0.015s using 8,092KB memory.
