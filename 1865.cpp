/* 1865. The Island of MÃ¤rket - http://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?num=1865
 *
 * Strategy:
 * There are two different cases we deal with.
 * 
 *   1) If the part between the east side of the lighthouse and the east coast is small enough
 *      we make the smallest possible strip of land along the east coast until we reach the level
 *      of the lighthouse, and then wrap the border around the lighthouse along its north, west and
 *      and south sides, continue to the east coast, and then make another thin strip south. Think
 *      of this as shrink-wrapping the tower towards the east. Then we can expand the border
 *      arbitrarily westwards to incorporate the amount of land we need.
 * 
 *   2) If the above mentioned part is too large, we wrap the border around the lighthouse partially
 *      along its eastern side as well, and shape it inside the area between the east wall and the
 *      coast appropriately, before returning to the coast and running along it.
 *
 * Performance:
 * O(h), runs the tests in 0.046s using 168KB memory.
