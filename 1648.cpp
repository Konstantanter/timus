/* 1648. Yachts - http://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?num=1648
 *
 * Strategy:
 * First, assume that the factory is producing at full capacity throughout the period and calculate
 * the number of yachts sold given the rules, which is the first answer. With this strategy, there
 * will be a number of yachts in storage at the end of the period, which serve no purpose but
 * increase the storage cost, so "continuously" remove one yacht/month worth of production from as
 * early as possible in the period (as early as possible is always the first month with 0 yachts in
 * storage as we keep removing production).
 *
 * Performance:
 * O(n) using 560KB of memory and runs the test cases at 0.001s which seems to be the fastest
 * solution to date.
