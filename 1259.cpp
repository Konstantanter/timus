/* 1259. How to Become Star? [sic] - http://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?num=1259
 *
 * Strategy:
 * We are looking for solutions of the form N*alpha = 2*k*pi, where 0 < alpha < pi, so the number of
 * different stars that we can find is the number of solutions to alpha = 2*pi*k/N, for alphas < pi
 * (k < N/2), where for each k generating an alpha we want k/N in lowest terms (have a gcd of 1) 
 * since otherwise that would be a solution for another star of a lower number of vertices, retraced
 * gcd(k, N) times.
 * 
 * Performance:
 * O(N log N), running the tests in 0.015s using 200KB memory.
