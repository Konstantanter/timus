/* 1665. Dean's Financial Pyramid - http://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?num=1665
 *
 * Strategy:
 * The problem asks us to construct the number N through some composition consisting of an uneven
 * number of factors besides 1. We can always combine any of the odd factors in the prime 
 * factorization to an arbitrary odd factor, but no 2's can be combined into a factor since even 
 * factors above 2 are not allowed according to the problem description. Therefore, we divide out
 * all twos, and note if the remaining number is 1, prime, or a composition, which will allow us 
 * to add an additional 0, 1 or 2 (ore more) factors as required beyond the 2's.
 * 
 * Performance:
 * O(T sqrt(N)), running the tests in 0.015s using 204KB memory.
