 * Strategy:
 * Dynamic programming. Store the solution for sentences of length k in A[k], and store the number
 * of strings that end  with some forbidden word i (0 < i < P), but does not contain any other 
 * forbidden words in F[i][k]. Assume we've calculated the solution for a string of length k. 
 * Iterate all of the following for each character c in the character set:
 * First, simply add A[k] to A[k+1]. This is the number of strings with k+1 characters that end 
 * with c that are valid, at least if you don't consider c. If c is the last letter of a forbidden
 * string, we might however have overestimated our solution, so we need to start subtracting the
 * number of strings of length k+1 that have a forbidden string as suffix that ends with c.
 * Therefore, for each such string of length l, we subtract A[k-l] from A[k+1], since that is the
 * number of otherwise valid strings that happen to end exactly in that forbidden string. However,
 * there is one more adjustment we need to make. There might be a string straddling the valid part
 * of the string and the forbidden part of the string. For example, let's say we have forbidden
 * strings aabb and bbcc in this situation:
 * We add c to the string KKKKKK (K here means all possibilities of characters), and end up with
 * KKKKKKc and need to remove all strings that end with bbcc, that is, KKKbbcc, from the solution.
 * This number is equal to the number of valid strings of three characters (KKK). However, when we
 * do this we also remove strings that look like Kaabbcc, which was never counted in the first 
 * place! This is where the array F comes in - we re-add all the strings of length 5 that end in
 * aabb (but have no other internal forbidden strings, otherwise we would have to recurse).
 * The final number of strings ending in bbcc is then used to update A[i][k+1], and removed from
 * A[k+1] (which we naively just added A[k] to to begin with).
 *
 * Performance:
 * O(MNP^2), runs the test suite in 0.015s using 468KB memory (ranked 10/740 and is the fastest
 * solution for the compiler used).
